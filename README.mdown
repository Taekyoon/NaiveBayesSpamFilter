# Bayesian Spam Filter  

We implement a [Bayesian spam filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_spam_filtering) in Python.

We first implemented the vanilla Bayesian filter, training on the data provided, and then extended it in various directions.

# Extensions

* Stemming using Porter's algorithm
* Cosine normalisation of feature weights
* Feature selection using WEKA.
